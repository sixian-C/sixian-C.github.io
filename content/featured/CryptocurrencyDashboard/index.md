I am very intersted in cryptocurrency and decide to do something about it using my data science skills.

I used Apache Spark Streaming to process real-time tweets for analyzing trending cryptocurrency hashtags and used Python to create an ETL pipeline that retrieved real-time cryptocurrency data from Coin-cap API, parsed and stored them into MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

Also leveraged capabilities of Metabase to build an interactive dashboard of cryptocurrency data.
