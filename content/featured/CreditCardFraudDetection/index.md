Utilized Python to create 15 features that capture abnormal transactions based on the R-F-M principle.

Trained unsupervised learning models (K-nearest neighbors, Auto Encoder, IsolationForest) using Oklahoma public credit card statements.

Captured and validated 1% anomalies from over 400,000 transaction records based on summary statistics, greatly reducing man-hours spent on fraud investigations.
